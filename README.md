Project: Analyzing Indian Premier League(IPL) Data

Explanation:
Sample Data: The data dictionary represents a simplified version of IPL data. In a real-world scenario, you would work with a much larger dataset with more features (e.g., individual player scores, bowling figures, etc.).
Pandas DataFrame: The pd.DataFrame(data) line creates a Pandas DataFrame from the dictionary.
EDA: The code demonstrates basic EDA steps:head() and info() to get an initial overview of the data. value_counts() to analyze the frequency of wins and player of the match awards. mean() to calculate the average runs scored.
Data Visualization:sns.countplot() creates a bar chart to visualize team wins.plt.hist() creates a histogram to show the distribution of runs scored. Expand the analysis by exploring more features, performing more in-depth calculations, and creating additional visualizations.
